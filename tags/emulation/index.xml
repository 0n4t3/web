            This is another one of my posts that&amp;rsquo;s effectively a few posts crammed together on related topics. Long story short, I started looking into handheld consoles a couple of months back, but in doing so picked up a handheld style controller for mobile instead. I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed that style of gameing, so I wound up circling back and pre-ordering a handheld from Retroid. In addition to talking about that, however, I&amp;rsquo;ve also rambled on about how I got started with emulation, and have some notes on the different handheld options I found during research.
