            So after two very long posts, one complaining about web browsers and one comparing the three big non-centralized social media protocols, I thought about writing two shorter posts about random things (hats and making sour krout specifically). However, between then and now stuffs happened and I thought I would make an anthology post with three different mini topics I wanted to share.
I made a client So yeah, I made a client that can post to Nostr, Activity Pub, and BlueSky (hopefully all of AT once it&amp;rsquo;s fully opened).

            Distributed social media networks have been on my mind for a while, especially during my deep dive into Nostr over the last few months. Being on my mind I started writing a comparison between the big three, which sort of morphed into this. I should clarify that I&amp;rsquo;m a layman here: I&amp;rsquo;ve never participated in the development of any of them, or the development of anything built on top of them (nor the development of anything complex at all).

            I have recently been re-dipping my toes into Nostr (tried it a while back just to experiment with it but never really stuck around), and so far it&amp;rsquo;s become my preferred microblogging platform. There&amp;rsquo;s a handful of reasons surrounding that, both in the protocol itself and what&amp;rsquo;s being built up around it, and I think it has a lot of promise that merits its very quick growth. Today I thought I would go over why I am a fan of it, and why I think it might be worth checking out if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in a more decentralized web.
