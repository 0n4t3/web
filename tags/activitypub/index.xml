            POV: You&amp;rsquo;re a professional dev watching me talk about vibe coding: Your browser does not support the video tag. I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly a stranger to using AI code, parts of nipy-bridge like the part that handles posts based on size was written by Chat GPT via Duck.AI, and I regularly use a Mixtral-Dolphin written bash script to convert files with avifenc. Recently, however, I came across Bookstr by MK Fain, which is being vibe coded.

            Update: September 20th, 2024: I was incorrect regarding AT&amp;rsquo;s (BlueSky) inability to fully delete things, the protocol DOES support fully deleting posts from the user&amp;rsquo;s repo and I&amp;rsquo;ve updated the post to reflect that. Read more. Big thanks to Ryan for providing the info.
Also, on a less important update (in regards to this post&amp;rsquo;s accuracy) - in keeping tradition with the original post - Bluesky has managed to change rapidly shortly after I finished this.

            Note: This post is out of date, here&amp;rsquo;s a more up to date version
Update August 5th 2024
I have some good and bad news regarding this post. First, I made two mistakes. AT crawlers are not in fact crawlers, they are called relays. Also, shared inboxes are actually part of the Activity Pub W3C standard as apposed to hacky additions to the protocol by third party servers. I was wrong about Activity Pub servers sending multiple messages to the same server remote to update it about a single post.
