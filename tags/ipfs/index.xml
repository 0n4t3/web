            A based design that makes a web that&amp;rsquo;s true
ICANNs and NATs embrace shall be no more
Behind a Pi or in the cloud for you
We use that tool be I2P or Tor
Come join a world of speech that can flow free
The words by truths of math they shall be bound
A power built right in that&amp;rsquo;s DHT
Identity by key pairs holds its ground
IPFS a poggers web design

            IPFS, an acronym for &amp;ldquo;InterPlanetary File System&amp;rdquo;, is a way to deliver files that takes a different approach to HTTP. As I mentioned in my very first post, I originally considered hosting my entire site/blog on it, and while I decided against it for reasons I mentioned there and reasons I&amp;rsquo;ll get into later here; I am working on something that may involve me sharing files here, which I&amp;rsquo;ll probably use IPFS for.
