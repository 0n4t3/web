      <title>This is Fine: an Interim Microblogging Protocols Update</title>
      <link>/posts/2025-12-07_microblog-protocols-update/</link>

            As is customary on my microblogging posts, let&amp;rsquo;s get us started with an original meme. Also, if you&amp;rsquo;d like to read my previous Microblogging Protocols compared posts, you can read v1 here and v2 here.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a little over a year since I made my updated microblogging protocols comparison. Since then a few things have happened, and my previous could use some trimming. In the spirit of keeping things shorter (and keeping the comparison v3 post relevant longer), I figured I&amp;rsquo;d split the post into two parts: this one, which includes random updates and things that happened over the last year or so - and a second one, &amp;ldquo;Microblogging Protocols Compared v3&amp;rdquo; which will be a more streamlined protocol comparison.

      <title>Rather Impressive Image Compression</title>

            Can you tell the difference between the two images above? At first glance, probably not. If you look at them side by side long enough, at least in fullscreen on an HD display, you might notice a little bit of a difference. In one the sky looks an ever so slightly darker shade, and if you look close enough, color shades seem to change in a more blocky structure instead of a more smooth transition.

      <title>Phone Reviews (Pixel 5a, 8a &#43; Mystery Phone)</title>

            Update: Everything worked in hugo&amp;rsquo;s test environment, but I guess local images in sliders breaks everything for who knows why once I actually published the post. I&amp;rsquo;m just going to replace some sliders with lists of images you can click on.
Before upgrading my phone I heard the Pixel 8a referred to as the &amp;ldquo;most boring phone ever,&amp;rdquo; and that seems like a good description of the phone - and something that I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of.

      <title>Non-Generative uses of Local LLMs</title>
      <link>/posts/2024-10-15_non-generative-llm-uses/</link>

            Update Oct. 21st: The transcription portion of the post has been updated, what I originally mistook as issues with how the data was formatted was an issue with too many tokens in the transcript I wanted transcribed.
At this point we all know how LLMs can generate text, and I&amp;rsquo;m guessing that everybody reading this knows some relatively lightweight libre LLMs can be installed and run locally. But, as you can probably guess by reading this, I enjoy writing stuff, so text generation isn&amp;rsquo;t really something that I have a use for.

            Update: September 20th, 2024: I was incorrect regarding AT&amp;rsquo;s (BlueSky) inability to fully delete things, the protocol DOES support fully deleting posts from the user&amp;rsquo;s repo and I&amp;rsquo;ve updated the post to reflect that. Read more. Big thanks to Ryan for providing the info.
Also, on a less important update (in regards to this post&amp;rsquo;s accuracy) - in keeping tradition with the original post - Bluesky has managed to change rapidly shortly after I finished this.

            This is sort of a successor to Firefox: A Brink of Their Own Making that I published ~6 months ago, followed by me rambling on about different browsers that I&amp;rsquo;ve used or decided to check out for this post. This follow-up was largely spurred on by two different things: Manifest v2&amp;rsquo;s phasing out in standard Chromium and Firefox getting worse. Further, after writing a whole lot and then reflecting on it, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a few more thoughts on the topics on hand - but unfortunately like the two external motivations, my thoughts have also led me to think about the ecosystem more negatively.

      <title>Confessions of a Data Hoarder</title>

            Okay, so I&amp;rsquo;m not actually sure I would consider myself a data hoarder, but I thought the title was pretty eye catching, and archival is close enough to data hoarding to only be moderately clickbaity. (I actually think I&amp;rsquo;ve got a pretty well organized and reasonably trimmed home directory). Anyway, I thought I would go over a couple of related topics, specifically my backup strategy, some data archiving, and me getting back into useing optical storage.

            What you are reading now is the fourth iteration of this post, which has gone through multiple revisions and re-considerations. It might feel a bit fragmented, but my aim is to provide a comprehensive post covering two related topics. The first part will discuss my experimentation with local LLMs (large language models), and the second will explore my personal philosophy and conclusions on AI. Feel free to only read one or the other.

            So after two very long posts, one complaining about web browsers and one comparing the three big non-centralized social media protocols, I thought about writing two shorter posts about random things (hats and making sour krout specifically). However, between then and now stuffs happened and I thought I would make an anthology post with three different mini topics I wanted to share.
I made a client So yeah, I made a client that can post to Nostr, Activity Pub, and BlueSky (hopefully all of AT once it&amp;rsquo;s fully opened).

            Note: This post is out of date, here&amp;rsquo;s a more up to date version
Update August 5th 2024
I have some good and bad news regarding this post. First, I made two mistakes. AT crawlers are not in fact crawlers, they are called relays. Also, shared inboxes are actually part of the Activity Pub W3C standard as apposed to hacky additions to the protocol by third party servers. I was wrong about Activity Pub servers sending multiple messages to the same server remote to update it about a single post.

            Update August 5th 2024
I have been made aware that Firefox for Android no longer includes Google Analytics as part of their app telemetry. It appears it was removed in v80.1.13. At the time I posted this the Exodus page I linked to did list Google Analytics, but according to the page now they updated the page on July 15th and likely removed the tracker information on that date.

            Chances are if you&amp;rsquo;re here it&amp;rsquo;s through an RSS feed (or an RSS feed bridged to something else), so I probably don&amp;rsquo;t need to do too much of an introduction. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick rundown if you&amp;rsquo;re unfamiliar. However, today I wanted to talk about RSS (as well as three other means of following content), how I&amp;rsquo;ve benefited from it, and a small project I started. Just about every piece of content I follow is through RSS - organized into different categories (news, blogs, videos, audio, etc), and the following benefits really stand out:

            I have recently been re-dipping my toes into Nostr (tried it a while back just to experiment with it but never really stuck around), and so far it&amp;rsquo;s become my preferred microblogging platform. There&amp;rsquo;s a handful of reasons surrounding that, both in the protocol itself and what&amp;rsquo;s being built up around it, and I think it has a lot of promise that merits its very quick growth. Today I thought I would go over why I am a fan of it, and why I think it might be worth checking out if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in a more decentralized web.

            Update 11/25: I was made aware that Signal has some proprietary anti-spam code and added the TLDR.
A More Technical TLDR I never know how much jargon I should include or how much I should explain, and as long as I&amp;rsquo;m writing I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying myself meaning I&amp;rsquo;ve been all over the place. But here&amp;rsquo;s a shortened version for those familiar with encryption.
A vanilla implementation of the Signal protocol relies on public key infrastructure to perform a handshake between devices.

      <title>What is IPFS &#43; basic use</title>

            IPFS, an acronym for &amp;ldquo;InterPlanetary File System&amp;rdquo;, is a way to deliver files that takes a different approach to HTTP. As I mentioned in my very first post, I originally considered hosting my entire site/blog on it, and while I decided against it for reasons I mentioned there and reasons I&amp;rsquo;ll get into later here; I am working on something that may involve me sharing files here, which I&amp;rsquo;ll probably use IPFS for.
