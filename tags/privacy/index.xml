            11/03/2023 Update: I fixed some grammar, and Google just announced they&amp;rsquo;re going to stop the implementation of WEI (hopefully permanently, but they may just be trying to outwait bad publicity and anti-trust actions - only time will tell).
If you read my first post here you probably got the idea I have strong feelings about recent versions of Windows, and you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be wrong. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of junk on Windows, but there are many ways you can go around and clean up some of the worst of it, and I thought I would go over a few potential ways of doing so.

            I never have had a good track record with massive changes to Windows, starting with Windows 8 which was entirely unusable in my case. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t just the mobile-style graphics and the bloat, but also the fact I couldnâ€™t get more than a couple of days before the installation would break. This went on for a while as I tried to figure out why it was breaking, and I probably went through dozens of installs that themselves took nearly as long as the time I could actually use the device before it broke again.
