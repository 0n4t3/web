            Can you tell the difference between the two images above? At first glance, probably not. If you look at them side by side long enough, at least in fullscreen on an HD display, you might notice a little bit of a difference. In one the sky looks an ever so slightly darker shade, and if you look close enough, color shades seem to change in a more blocky structure instead of a more smooth transition.

            Like a lot of my posts, this kind of kept growing. Going over my photos I kept finding a bunch of favorites I wanted to share outside just using ones for effects, so now I&amp;rsquo;ve got a photos page if you want to check them out.
You might have played around with AI image generation, getting a little hit of dopamine whenever you get something that looks visually pleasing without actually putting in any effort.
