            I was thinking about making a personal update, then saw a post on Joelchrono’s blog about the 10 useless facts about me challenge, so I thought I’d combine both of those into one post.
Fairly recently, I left my job to relocate back to my home state of New York, and have been looking for work more locally. I kind of expected work to be a bit hard to come by, and planned accordingly, but that still doesn’t make the job search any less of a slog.

      <title>Making Pickles and Sauerkraut (the lazy way)</title>

            I&amp;rsquo;ve made three long posts about decentralized social media, followed by making a client that works on decentralized social media, so I&amp;rsquo;ll call all that good for now and talk about making some pickles and sourkraut. And not just canned cucumbers and cabbage, but the actual fermented stuff, which is surprisingly easy to make.
So, the lazy way to make Sourkraut: Boil some water on the stove or in a kettle (makes sure it&amp;rsquo;s sterile and cuts out some of the chlorine if you&amp;rsquo;re on city water), then let it start to cool until it&amp;rsquo;s about room temperature Cut up some cabbage.

            I ran across a neat trend of sharing your default apps, and a collection of posts doing so. It&amp;rsquo;s made some interesting reads and I thought I would join in and post my own favorites.
My Devices I have three different devices: a PC running Debian, a tablet I just got setup running Debian and a Waydroid container, and a phone running the Graphene fork of Android.

      <title>Subdomain Change</title>
      <link>/posts/2023-09-24_subdomain-change/</link>

            TLDR Even though it&amp;rsquo;s only been three months since I created my blog here, I&amp;rsquo;m going to change the domain from www.mecca1.net to nate.mecca1.net instead. Nothing&amp;rsquo;s should break, www.mecca1.net will forward to nate.mecca1.net for now. Still, if you&amp;rsquo;re following me through RSS or you have my site bookmarked it might be worth swapping out the URL.
Longer Update My domain predates my blog by about six years, so when I created my blog a few months ago I opted to just use the www subdomain.

            I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to start a blog here. I got this domain with some DNS records just collecting dust, and have an interest in writing stuff casually. I figure I&amp;rsquo;ll write about projects I work on or opinions about things in my field whenever something interests me enough to talk about it. I probably won&amp;rsquo;t write too much about myself personally though, if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this you probably A) know me already and somehow got roped into reading this, B) we&amp;rsquo;re working on some sort of project and you&amp;rsquo;re interested in reading about my writing about it, or C) find my writing about something interesting or useful (the latter being the most unlikely).
