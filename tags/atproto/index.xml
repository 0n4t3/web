In January of 2024 I published a blog post comparing Activity Pub, Nostr, and AT, and this is a revised version of that post. There are a few reasons why I went about making an updated version. First, I got a couple of things wrong - specifically not realizing SharedInboxes were part of the official Activity Pub standard and mistakenly calling AT relays AT crawlers.

            Note: This post is out of date, here&amp;rsquo;s a more up to date version
Update August 5th 2024
I have some good and bad news regarding this post. First, I made two mistakes. AT crawlers are not in fact crawlers, they are called relays. Also, shared inboxes are actually part of the Activity Pub W3C standard as apposed to hacky additions to the protocol by third party servers. I was wrong about Activity Pub servers sending multiple messages to the same server remote to update it about a single post.
