            At this point we all know how LLMs can generate text, and I&amp;rsquo;m guessing that everybody reading this knows some relatively lightweight libre LLMs can be installed and run locally. But, as you can probably guess by reading this, I enjoy writing stuff, so text generation isn&amp;rsquo;t really something that I have a use for. The knowledge stored in them is helpful for sure; I use local LLMs to find data or troubleshoot something on probably more or less a once-a-week basis (because I&amp;rsquo;m not connected to the internet, can&amp;rsquo;t find what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for in search engines, want to ask about an error code in plain English, etc).

            I count myself lucky to live in a pretty stable and safe part of the world. The last three years or so might have been slightly less so, but still in the scheme of things I certainly haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the worst of it. But hey, this year is as good of any to think about useful ways to utilize your electronics, specifically your phone, if the power goes out or something similar happens.
