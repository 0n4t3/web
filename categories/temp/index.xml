            Quick note: I&amp;rsquo;ll probably delete this post at some point. It&amp;rsquo;s more of me using my RSS to share something that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on and less of a real blog post. Just thought I would mention so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like I&amp;rsquo;m retracting anything and to give a heads up in case you were planning on bookmarking it.
Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a novel aptly named &amp;ldquo;An Untitled Novel&amp;rdquo;.
