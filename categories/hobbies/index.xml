            Like a lot of my posts, this kind of kept growing. Going over my photos I kept finding a bunch of favorites I wanted to share outside just using ones for effects, so now I&amp;rsquo;ve got a photos page if you want to check them out.
You might have played around with AI image generation, getting a little hit of dopamine whenever you get something that looks visually pleasing without actually putting in any effort.

      <title>Making a Fur Hat</title>

            In my post about EDC I rambled on about hats for a bit, and a couple weeks ago I decided to try making one myself. I didn&amp;rsquo;t initially plan on writing a blog post explaining how I did it; however, after having trouble finding a printable pattern, I wound up just winging it, and I figured I&amp;rsquo;d put my process out there.1 Fur hats are way warmer than just about anything else, and even though this was a trial run with a fake polyester fur pelt it&amp;rsquo;s still a warm hat on its own.

            Dropdown: Random notes from drafting Alright, it is April 2nd and I&amp;rsquo;m typing out the first couple of characters in this document which I can already guess is going to be another long post. I already have tons of posts that I expected to be medium length which ballooned out, so given I know ahead of time it&amp;rsquo;ll be long who knows how long it will be. Err, well, editing me and you the reader will know how long it is when I actually publish it.

      <title>Making Pickles and Sauerkraut (the lazy way)</title>

            I&amp;rsquo;ve made three long posts about decentralized social media, followed by making a client that works on decentralized social media, so I&amp;rsquo;ll call all that good for now and talk about making some pickles and sourkraut. And not just canned cucumbers and cabbage, but the actual fermented stuff, which is surprisingly easy to make.
So, the lazy way to make Sourkraut: Boil some water on the stove or in a kettle (makes sure it&amp;rsquo;s sterile and cuts out some of the chlorine if you&amp;rsquo;re on city water), then let it start to cool until it&amp;rsquo;s about room temperature Cut up some cabbage.

      <title>Quest to find a tablet, pt 2</title>

            This is my second post about searching for a tablet, and a follow-up review of the device I mentioned purchasing in the last post (an MS Surface Go tablet). Aside from the fact I just find it relaxing to write about things that interest or affect me, I hope that this would be useful if you&amp;rsquo;re considering buying an MS Surface tablet (to run either Win/Linux), or if you&amp;rsquo;re purchasing a different tablet to run Linux and want to know how a potential configuration might look.

            I ran across a neat trend of sharing your default apps, and a collection of posts doing so. It&amp;rsquo;s made some interesting reads and I thought I would join in and post my own favorites.
My Devices I have three different devices: a PC running Debian, a tablet I just got setup running Debian and a Waydroid container, and a phone running the Graphene fork of Android.

            TLDR, for those looking for less of a novel I did a lot of looking and found a few different options if you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a tablet and have similar preferences as me. There are custom ROMs for some tablets, though they are somewhat limited in which devices are supported (as well as sometimes limits on features or time in which security updates come in). There&amp;rsquo;s also the ability to cut out junk with ADB bridge on Android tablets, of which some cheaper tablets are sketchy and lack long-term security updates, and some of the premium tablets can get pricey.
